1
  Kernel: The kernel is the core component of the Linux system that interacts directly with the hardware. 
  It manages resources such as memory, CPU, and input/output operations. It also provides interfaces for user-space programs to access the hardware.

2
  Shell: The shell is the interface between the user and the kernel. It provides a command-line interface 
  (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) for the user to interact with the system. The shell interprets user commands and executes them.

3
  Filesystem: The filesystem is a hierarchical structure that organizes files and directories in the 
  Linux system. It provides a way to access and manage data on disk or other storage devices.

4
  Device drivers: Device drivers are programs that allow the kernel to communicate with hardware devices 
  such as network cards, disk drives, and printers. They provide an abstraction layer between the hardware and the kernel.
  
5
  System libraries: System libraries are collections of pre-compiled code that provide common functions 
  and services to user-space programs. They include libraries for networking, graphics, and file handling.

6
  User-space programs: User-space programs are applications that run on top of the kernel. They interact 
  with the kernel through system calls, which provide a way to access kernel services and resources.
